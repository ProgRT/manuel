abstract = {The mechanisms governing gas flow, gas mixing, and pressure transmission during high-frequency oscillatory ventila-tion (HFOV) are fundamentally different to ventilation at more conventional respi-ratory breathing frequencies. They are in-tegrally related to each other through the prevailing mechanical characteristics of the intubated respiratory system and fre-quency, symmetry, and magnitude of the applied pressure waveform. An apprecia-tion of these mechanisms, and their im-plications for gas mixing efficiency, and the appropriate selection and matching of ventilator settings to the mechanical properties of the intubated respiratory system represent essential knowledge foundations for the clinician who uses HFOV to treat respiratory disease in the adult. This article aims to summarize the known mechanisms of gas mixing and to discuss the impact of lung mechanics on pressure transmission, flow generation, and the efficiency of ventilation and how each of these interact with each other during HFOV. A brief overview of the practical difficulties and progress achieved to date in measuring lung me-chanics during HFOV is given and the relevance of measuring lung mechanics to optimization of clinical application of HFOV in acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) is reviewed.},
